## Project's Goal
Exploring a NBA dataset (containing player names, info &amp; stats from 96'-97' season to 21'-22' season) with SQL queries and visualizing SQL views with Tableau Public.

I used SQL queries to answer questions concerning the NBA players such as:
- What teams had the most top 10 picks in the draft?
- Do players of certain height get drafted more often?
- Does players height affect their stats?

And more
